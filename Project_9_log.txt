--OLA Project--

1. Clean your excel dataset by removing the duplicates from it (Data Tab → Data tools group → Remove duplicates)
2. Create a database in SQL and give it a name (I named it 'Ola').
3. Now in this new database, create a table in query tool

Code:

CREATE TABLE Bookings(
	Date TIMESTAMP,
	Time TIME,
	Booking_ID VARCHAR(50), 
	Booking_Status VARCHAR(50),
	Customer_ID	VARCHAR(50),
	Vehicle_Type VARCHAR(50),
	Pickup_Location	VARCHAR(200),
	Drop_Location VARCHAR(200),
	V_TAT INT,
	C_TAT INT,
	Canceled_Rides_by_Customer VARCHAR(200),
	Canceled_Rides_by_Driver VARCHAR(200),
	Incomplete_Rides VARCHAR(15),
	Incomplete_Rides_Reason	VARCHAR(150),
	Booking_Value INT,
	Payment_Method VARCHAR(50),
	Ride_Distance FLOAT,
	Driver_Ratings FLOAT,
	Customer_Rating FLOAT,
	Vehicle_Images TEXT
	)
4. Now Import data into this table by right clicking on the table and selecting import/export and properly navigating the options.
If it shows any error due to the fact that it was set up to "add a comma after every field" without a special rule to skip the very last one.

Use the following code to add another column for it:

ALTER TABLE Bookings
ADD COLUMN Extra_Column TEXT;

This will add an empty column for the extra commas present in your csv file.

5. Check the data you imported by running the following functions to see the data:

SELECT * FROM Bookings; ,
SELECT DISTINCT Extra_Column FROM Bookings; ,
etc.

6. Now lets solve the following business related questions by performing Sql operations and EDA.

SQL Questions:
1. Retrieve all successful bookings:

Code:

CREATE VIEW Successful_Bookings AS   --Created a view so that its temporarily stored on the sql database to avoid running the program again and again
SELECT * FROM Bookings
WHERE booking_status = 'Success';

SELECT * FROM Successful_Bookings;


2. Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type:

Code:

CREATE VIEW ride_dist_each_vehicle
AS
SELECT 
	vehicle_type,
	ROUND(AVG(ride_distance)::NUMERIC, 2) AS Avg_Distance --you may also use CAST Function to temporarily change its datatype for this operation
FROM Bookings
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC; 


3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers:

Code:

CREATE VIEW Cancelled_By_Cust
AS
SELECT 
	COUNT(*) AS total_cancelled_rides_by_customer
FROM Bookings
WHERE Booking_Status ILIKE '%Canceled By Customer%';

SELECT * FROM Cancelled_By_Cust;

4. List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides:

Code:

CREATE VIEW top_5_bookers
AS
SELECT
	customer_id,
	COUNT(*) AS total_no_of_bookings
FROM Bookings
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;

--Run the above bit first to save the view and THEN do the below one to see the data

SELECT * FROM top_5_bookers;

5. Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues:

Code:

CREATE VIEW rides_cancelled_due_to_pnc_reasons
AS
SELECT
	COUNT(*) AS Total_no_of_rides_cancelled
FROM Bookings
WHERE canceled_rides_by_driver = 'Personal & Car related issue';

SELECT * FROM rides_cancelled_due_to_pnc_reasons;

6. Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings:

Code:

CREATE VIEW ratings_for_sedan
AS
SELECT 
	vehicle_type,
	MAX(driver_ratings) AS Max_rating_for_Sedan,
	MIN(driver_ratings) AS Min_rating_for_Sedan
FROM Bookings
WHERE vehicle_type = 'Prime Sedan'
GROUP BY 1;

SELECT * FROM ratings_for_sedan;

7. Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI:

Code:

CREATE VIEW All_UPI_Payments
AS
SELECT
	*
FROM Bookings
WHERE
	payment_method = 'UPI';

SELECT * FROM All_UPI_Payments;

8. Find the average customer rating per vehicle type:

Code:

CREATE VIEW Avg_Crating_per_Vehicle
AS
SELECT
	vehicle_type,
	ROUND(AVG(customer_rating)::NUMERIC, 2) AS Avg_cust_rating_per_vehicle
FROM Bookings
GROUP BY 1;

SELECT * FROM Avg_Crating_per_Vehicle;


9. Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully:

Code:


CREATE VIEW total_success_booking_value
AS
SELECT 
	SUM(booking_value) AS total_successful_ride_value
FROM Bookings
WHERE booking_status ILIKE 'Success';

SELECT * FROM total_success_booking_value;

10. List all incomplete rides along with the reason:

Code:

CREATE VIEW incomplete_ride_reasons
AS
SELECT 
	booking_id,
	incomplete_rides_reason
FROM Bookings
WHERE 
	incomplete_rides ILIKE 'yes';

7. With that we've done all the exploratory analysis, thereby giving answers to all the necessary business questions.
